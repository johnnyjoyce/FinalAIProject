		<description>You have arrived at the current location of the Holy Grail. Before you can retrieve you must speak to its protectors. Once you have aqcuired the Holy Grail, you have three options in which direction to go. First is along the coast to Netanya, the quickest of all the routes, but, word has spread of increased enemy movement along this path. Your next choice is to travel to Beit She'an, a more safe route inland, although not as quick. Finally is the route furtherest inland, to Amman. Now this maybe the longest route but it is by far the safest.
